## Ques:

## How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?

**Ans:** 

When deciding on the technical and architectural choices for a solution, I employ a structured approach to ensure alignment with project requirements and best practices:

1. **Requirements Analysis**:
   a. **Functional Requirements**: Assess the application's feature set and user interactions.
   b. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Evaluate performance, scalability, security, maintainability, and user experience needs.

2. **Technology Stack Selection**:
   a. **Suitability**: Choose technologies that best meet the project's requirements, such as React for dynamic UIs.
   b. **Ecosystem and Community Support**: Opt for technologies with robust ecosystems and strong community support for better resources and problem-solving.
   c. **Team Expertise**: Leverage the team's existing skills to enhance productivity and reduce the learning curve.

3. **Architecture Design**:
   a. **Scalability**: Design scalable architectures, like microservices, to handle future growth and increased load.
   b. **Modularity and Reusability**: Implement a modular design to promote code reusability and ease of maintenance.
   c. **Separation of Concerns**: Ensure clear separation of concerns to improve code organization and manageability.

This methodical approach helps in building robust, scalable, and maintainable solutions tailored to project needs.

## Ques

## Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

**Ans:**

Yes, I have not implemented responsiveness fully to my site, as i tried to complete it on time but I was not able to! Therefore, I will at first make the web app fully responsive and working as a part of improvement.

## Ques 

## What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

**Ans:**

If allocated more time, I would approach the project differently in several key areas:

1. **Detailed Planning and Research**:
   - I would invest more time in thorough planning and researching new technologies and tools that could enhance the project’s efficiency and performance.

2. **Code Optimization**:
   - I would focus on optimizing the code to improve performance, readability, and maintainability, ensuring that it meets high standards of quality.

3. **Extensive Testing**:
   - I would implement more extensive testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing, to ensure the application is bug-free and reliable.

4. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - I would add additional features that were initially deprioritized due to time constraints, providing a more comprehensive solution.

5. **Comprehensive Documentation**:
   - I would create more detailed and comprehensive documentation to facilitate easier understanding and maintenance by future developers.

6. **User Feedback Integration**:
   - I would gather and integrate user feedback to ensure the end product is more user-friendly and meets the users’ needs more effectively.

By focusing on these areas, I could deliver a more refined, robust, and user-centric product if given more time.
